// Factory pattern is another class-based creational pattern. 
// In this, we provide a generic interface that delegates the responsibility of object instantiation to its subclasses.
// This pattern is frequently used when we need to manage or manipulate collections of objects that are different 
// yet have many similar characteristics.

// Dynamic object creation: It can be used in cases where the type of the object is decided at runtime.
// Abstraction: The user never really has to access the actual objectâ€™s constructor.
// Reusability/Maintenance: Same factories can be used for similar objects and it allows us to add/remove new object classes easily without changing a lot of code.
